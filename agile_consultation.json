    "content": "To set up a Kanban board for your 1-5 members team in IT, follow these steps:\n1. Identify your workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).\n2. Create a digital board using Trello or Jira with 3-5 columns reflecting these stages.\n3. Add tasks as cards, including descriptions and due dates.\n4. Set Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits (e.g., 2-3 tasks per column) to prevent overloading.\n5. Review and update the board daily in standups.\nImplementation tips for 1-5 members:\n- Keep columns simple to match your small team’s capacity.\n- Use visual cues (e.g., color labels) for task types.\n- Adjust WIP limits weekly based on flow.\nSince faster delivery is a goal, optimize flow to reduce Cycle Time.\n"
